PUTAIN The use of argumentation in education has been shown to improve critical thinking skills for end-users such as students, and computational models for argumentation have been developed to assist in this process. Although these models are useful for evaluating the quality of an argument, they oftentimes cannot explain why a particular argument is considered poor or not, which makes it difficult to provide constructive feedback to users to strengthen their critical thinking skills.

This website collects references for explanations in argumentation, ultimately helping learners improve their critical thinking skills.

Explanations are grouped by type: 

* [Shallow Explanations](/explain_arguments/shallow)
* [In-Depth Explanations](/explain_arguments/in-depth)
* [Interactive Explanations](/explain_arguments/interactive)
